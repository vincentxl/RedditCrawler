# Subreddit Crawler and Network Visualization

The goal of this project is to graphically visualize the subreddit space surrounding an original chosen subreddit. 

This program, as it crawls through subreddit descriptions, records links between subreddits. After it finishes crawling, it exports .gexf file (Graphical Exchange XML Format) filed that can be used in Gephi, an open-source network visualization software package.

Python packages used: PRAW, re, Pandas, NetworkX
